# MIS374_CreativeAction
Served as a technical consulting team to a nonprofit in the Austin-area in the Fall 2021 semester

Due to the confidential nature of our consulting project, I am unable to share actual code.
Instead, I have attached our final client deliverable presentation.

We built a backend solution comprising of a mix of pre-packaged and custom tools to improve our clients data efficiency and reduce data redundancy in their
CRM and databases. I served as the Product and Project Manager for the team and advised the client on tech strategy in order to guide our engineering 
team to develop the most feasible solution
